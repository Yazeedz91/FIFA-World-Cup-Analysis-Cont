Deeper look into the Champion's Curse - FIFA World Cup

Abstract

1- FIFA World Cup is one of the biggest sports events in the world, it attracts millions of attendees and viewers when it occurs every 4 years. 

2- With many eyes on the event, there are bound to be some deep analysis and theories surrounding it and the teams involved, and one of these theories is the Champion's curse which suggests that teams that win the world cup, get kicked out of the next World Cup very early in its stages. 

3- This research attempts to look into this problem by analyzing World Cup winnersâ€™ performance during the World Cup they win, and the matches after. 

4- By analyzing their performance, we find out if this "curse" does exist or teams do indeed try their best. 

5- We begin by comparing teams' performance in the World Cup they win, and the matches they have in the next 4 years before the next World Cup Championship, we do so by comparing a new variable of score difference that sums the number of goals they scored, and goals they allowed in their own net. 

6- Next, we attempt to find out if international matches in any tournament other than FIFA World Cup would be a good predictor of team's performance in the World Cup using linear regression models. 

7- Finally, we look into other factors in a football match that may have any impact on team's performance such as the referee supervising the match, the tournament the team participating in, and the stage they are at in the World Cup. 

8- We found that teams do maintain their performance that allowed them to win the World Cup in international matches, however their performance there is not a good predictor of World Cup matches. Additionally, we found that there are other factors that have an impact on teams' performance such as tournaments. 

9- This research is limited by the absence of many other variables that could contribute to a team's performance, future research could potentially find a better metric to measure team's performance and predictor for World Cup matches.
